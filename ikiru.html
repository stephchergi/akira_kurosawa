	<h1>Ikiru</h1>
	
	<p>
	Ikiru ((<span lang="ja-jp">生きる</span>, "To Live") is a 1952 Japanese drama film directed and co-written by Akira Kurosawa and starring Takashi Shimura. The film examines the struggles of a terminally ill Tokyo bureaucrat and his final quest for meaning. The screenplay was partly inspired by Leo Tolstoy's 1886 novella <cite>The Death of Ivan Ilyich</cite>.

	<p>
	The major themes of the film include learning how to live, the inefficiency of bureaucracy, and decaying family life in Japan, which have been the subject of analysis by academics and critics. The film has received widespread critical acclaim, and in Japan won awards for Best Film at the <cite>Kinema Junpo</cite> and <cite>Mainichi Film Awards</cite>. It was remade as a television film in 2007.

	<h2>Themes</h2>
	<h3>Living</h3>
	<p>
	Death is a major theme in the film, which leads to the protagonist Watanabe's quest to find the meaning of life. Initially, Watanabe looks to nightclubs and women to live life to the fullest, but winds up singing the 1915 song <cite>"Gondola no Uta"</cite> as an expression of loss. Professor Alexander Sesonske writes that in the nightclub scene, Watanabe realizes "pleasure is not life," and that a goal gives him new happiness, with the song <cite>"Happy Birthday to You"</cite> symbolizing his rebirth. Because Toyo is young, she has the best insight as to how to live, and is presented as the "unlikely savior" in Watanabe's "redemption."</p>
	
	<p>
	Author Donald Richie wrote that the title of the film, meaning simply "to live," could signify that "existence is enough." However, Watanabe finds existence is painful, and takes this as inspiration, wanting to ensure his life has not been futile. The justification of his life, found in his park, is how Watanabe discovered how "to live." In the end, Watanabe now sings <cite>"Gondola no Uta"</cite> with great contentment.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Bureaucracy</h3>
	<p><cite>Ikiru</cite> is also an "indictment of Japanese bureaucracy." In Japan after World War II, it was expected that the <span lang="ja-jp">sararīman</span> (salary man) would work predictably in accordance with an organization's rules. The scene where the mothers first visit the city office requesting a playground shows "unconcern" in the bureaucrats, who send the visitors on a "farcical runaround," before asking them for a written request, with paperwork in the film symbolizing "meaningless activity." Despite this, Watanabe uses the bureaucracy to forge his legacy, and is apparently not disturbed when the bureaucracy quickly forgets he drove the project to build the playground.
	</p>
	<p>
	Japanese health care is also depicted as overly bureaucratic in the film, as Watanabe visits a clinic in a "poignant" scene. The doctor is portrayed as paternalistic, and Watanabe does not stand up to his authority.</p>
