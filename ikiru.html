		Ikiru ((<span lang="ja-jp">生きる</span>, "To Live") is a <time>1952</time> Japanese drama film directed and co-written by Akira Kurosawa and starring Takashi Shimura. The film examines the struggles of a terminally ill Tokyo bureaucrat and his final quest for meaning. The screenplay was partly inspired by Leo Tolstoy's <time>1886</time> novella <cite>The Death of Ivan Ilyich</cite>.
		</p>
		<p>
		The major themes of the film include learning how to live, the inefficiency of bureaucracy, and decaying family life in Japan, which have been the subject of analysis by academics and critics. The film has received widespread critical acclaim, and in Japan won awards for Best Film at the <cite>Kinema Junpo</cite> and <cite>Mainichi Film Awards</cite>. It was remade as a television film in <time>2007</time>.

	<h2>Themes</h2>
	<h3>Living</h3>
	<p>
	Death is a major theme in the film, which leads to the protagonist Watanabe's quest to find the meaning of life. Initially, Watanabe looks to nightclubs and women to live life to the fullest, but winds up singing the 1915 song <cite>"Gondola no Uta"</cite> as an expression of loss. Professor Alexander Sesonske writes that in the nightclub scene, Watanabe realizes "pleasure is not life," and that a goal gives him new happiness, with the song <cite>"Happy Birthday to You"</cite> symbolizing his rebirth. Because Toyo is young, she has the best insight as to how to live, and is presented as the "unlikely savior" in Watanabe's "redemption."</p>
	
	<p>
	Author Donald Richie wrote that the title of the film, meaning simply "to live," could signify that "existence is enough." However, Watanabe finds existence is painful, and takes this as inspiration, wanting to ensure his life has not been futile. The justification of his life, found in his park, is how Watanabe discovered how "to live." In the end, Watanabe now sings <cite>"Gondola no Uta"</cite> with great contentment.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Bureaucracy</h3>
	<p><cite>Ikiru</cite> is also an "indictment of Japanese bureaucracy." In Japan after World War II, it was expected that the <span lang="ja-jp">sararīman</span> (salary man) would work predictably in accordance with an organization's rules. The scene where the mothers first visit the city office requesting a playground shows "unconcern" in the bureaucrats, who send the visitors on a "farcical runaround," before asking them for a written request, with paperwork in the film symbolizing "meaningless activity." Despite this, Watanabe uses the bureaucracy to forge his legacy, and is apparently not disturbed when the bureaucracy quickly forgets he drove the project to build the playground.
	</p>
	<p>
	Japanese health care is also depicted as overly bureaucratic in the film, as Watanabe visits a clinic in a "poignant" scene. The doctor is portrayed as paternalistic, and Watanabe does not stand up to his authority.</p>
	
	<h3>Family Life</h3>
	<p>
	Author Timothy Iles writes that, as with Yasujirō Ozu's 1953 film <cite>Tokyo Story</cite>, Ikiru may hold a negative view about the state of family life in modern Japan. Watanabe has lived with his son for years, but they have fallen out of any true relationship. His son, Mitsuo, sees Watanabe as a bother, and sees him as standing in the way of money in Watanabe's will. The children fall short of their responsibility to respect their parents.
	</p>
	<p>
	Urbanization may be a reason for negative changes in Japanese society, although a reason for Watanabe and Mitsuo's drift is also Watanabe's preoccupation with work. Another reason is Watanabe not being with Mitsuo during a medical treatment when the boy was 10, which fits a pattern in Kurosawa's films of sons being overly harsh to their fathers.

	<h2>Production</h2>
	<p>
	The film marked the first collaboration between director Akira Kurosawa and screenwriter Hideo Oguni. According to Oguni, the genesis of the film was Kurosawa's desire to make a film about a man who knows he is going to die, and wants a reason to live for a short time. Oguni was an experienced writer and was offered ¥500,000, while co-writer Shinobu Hashimoto was offered ¥150,000. Initially, Kurosawa told Hashimoto that a man who was set to die in 75 days had to be the theme, and that the character's career was less important, with the director saying criminal, homeless man or government minister would be acceptable.
	</p>
	<p>
	The screenwriters consulted Leo Tolstoy's novella <cite>The Death of Ivan Ilyich</cite>, and Oguni envisioned placing Watanabe's death halfway through the film. Kurosawa dictated the scene where Watanabe is on the swing, and mentioned the beginning lyrics of <cite>"Gondola no Uta."</cite> Since none of the men were familiar with the song, they consulted their eldest receptionist on the rest of the lyrics and the song title.
	</p>
	<p>
	Kurosawa renamed the draft <cite>The Life of Kanji Watanabe</cite> to <cite>Ikiru</cite>, which Hashimoto found pretentious, but Oguni supported. The screenplay was completed on <time datetime="1952-02-05">5 February 1952</time>.

		<h2>Reception</h2>
		<h3>Critical Reception</h3>
		<p>
		The film won critical approval upon its release. Bosley Crowther, writing for <cite>The New York Times</cite>, called it "a strangely fascinating and affecting film, up to a point—that being the point where it consigns its aged hero to the great beyond," which he deemed "anti-climactic." Crowther praised Shimura, saying he "measures up through his performance in this picture with the top film actors anywhere," and complimented Miki Odagiri, Nobuo Kaneko and Yunosuke Ito. <cite>Variety</cite> staff called the film "a tour-de-force," by "keeping a dramatic thread throughout and avoiding the mawkish."
		</p>
		<p>
		Roger Ebert added it to his list of Great Movies in 1996, saying, "Over the years I have seen <cite>Ikiru</cite> every five years or so, and each time it has moved me, and made me think. And the older I get, the less Watanabe seems like a pathetic old man, and the more he seems like every one of us." In his Great Movies review of <cite>Seven Samurai</cite>, Ebert called it Kurosawa's greatest film. In <time>2008</time>, Wally Hammond of <cite>Time Out</cite> praised <cite>Ikiru</cite> as "one of the triumphs of humanist cinema." That year, <cite>The New Yorker's</cite> Michael Sragow described it as a "masterwork," noting Kurosawa was usually associated more with his action films. The scene featuring Watanabe on the swing in the playground he built has been described as "iconic."
		</p>
		<p>
		<cite>Empire</cite> magazine ranked <cite>Ikiru</cite> ranks 459th on its <time>2008</time> list of the 500 greatest movies of all time, and 44th in "The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema" in <time>2010</time>. Conversely, in <time>2016</time> <cite>The Daily Telegraph</cite> named it one of the 10 most overrated films. The film has a 100% positive rating from critics at the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 32 reviews.

		<h3>Accolades</h3>
		<p>
		The film competed for the Golden Bear at the 4th Berlin International Film Festival in <time>1954</time>.</p>

		<h2>Legacy</h2></a>
		<p>Kurosawa believed William Shakespeare's play <cite>Macbeth</cite> could serve as a cautionary tale complementing <cite>Ikiru</cite>, thus directing his <time>1957</time> film <cite>Throne of Blood</cite>. <cite>Ikiru</cite> was remade as a Japanese television film that debuted on TV Asahi on <time datetime="2007-09-09">9 September 2007</time>, the day after a remake of Kurosawa's <cite>High and Low</cite>. The <cite>Ikiru</cite> remake stars <span lang="ja-jp">kabuki</span> actor Matsumoto Kōshirō IX.
