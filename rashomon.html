<p>
Rashomon (<span lang="ja-jp">羅生門 Rashōmon</span>) is a 1950 Japanese period film directed by Akira Kurosawa, working in close collaboration with cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa. It stars Toshiro Mifune, Machiko Kyō, Masayuki Mori, and Takashi Shimura. While the film borrows the title and setting from Ryūnosuke Akutagawa's short story <cite>"Rashōmon"</cite>, it is actually based on Akutagawa's short story <cite>"In a Grove"</cite>, which provides the characters and plot.

The film is known for a plot device that involves various characters providing subjective, alternative, self-serving and contradictory versions of the same incident. Rashomon marked the entrance of Japanese film onto the world stage; it won several awards, including the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1951, and an Academy Honorary Award at the 24th <cite>Academy Awards<cite> in 1952, and is now considered one of the greatest films ever made.
