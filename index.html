	Akira Kurosawa (<span lang="ja-jp">黒沢 明</span>, <time datetime="1910-03-23">March 23, 1910</time> – <time datetime="1998-09-06">September 6, 1998</time>) was a Japanese film director and screenwriter. Regarded as one of the most important and influential filmmakers in the history of cinema, he directed 30 films in a career spanning 57 years.

	Kurosawa entered the Japanese film industry in 1936, following a brief stint as a painter. After years of working on numerous films as an assistant director and scriptwriter, he made his debut as a director during World War II with the popular action film <cite>Sanshiro Sugata</cite> (a.k.a. Judo Saga). After the war, the critically acclaimed <cite>Drunken Angel</cite> (1948), in which Kurosawa cast then-unknown actor Toshiro Mifune in a starring role, cemented the director's reputation as one of the most important young filmmakers in Japan. The two men would go on to collaborate on another 15 films.

	<p><cite>Rashomon</cite>, which premiered in Tokyo, became the surprise winner of the Golden Lion at the 1952 Venice Film Festival. The commercial and critical success of that film opened up Western film markets for the first time to the products of the Japanese film industry, which in turn led to international recognition for other Japanese filmmakers. Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, Kurosawa directed approximately a film a year, including a number of highly regarded (and often adapted) films, such as <cite>Ikiru</cite> (1952), <cite>Seven Samurai</cite> (1954) and <cite>Yojimbo</cite> (1961). After the 1960s, he became much less prolific, though his later work—including his final two epics, <cite>Kagemusha</cite> (1980) and <cite>Ran</cite> (1985)—continued to win awards though more often abroad than in Japan.

	In 1990, he accepted the Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement. Posthumously, he was named "Asian of the Century" in the "Arts, Literature, and Culture" category by AsianWeek magazine and CNN, cited there as being among the five people who most prominently contributed to the improvement of Asia in the past century. His career has been honored by many retrospectives, critical studies and biographies in both print and video, and by releases in many consumer media formats.
