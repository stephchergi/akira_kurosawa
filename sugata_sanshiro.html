<cite>Sanshiro Sugata</cite> (<span lang="ja-jp">姿三四郎 Sugata Sanshirō</span>, <abbr aria-label="also known as">a.k.a.</abbr> Judo Saga) is the directorial debut of the Japanese film director Akira Kurosawa. First released in Japan on <time timedate="1943-3-25">25 March 1943</time> by Toho film studios, the film was eventually released in the United States on 2<time timedate="1974-5-8">8 April 1974</time>. The film is based on the novel of the same name written by Tsuneo Tomita, the son of prominent judoka Tsunejirō Tomita. It follows the story of Sanshiro, a talented though willful youth, who travels to the city in order to learn Jujutsu. However, upon his arrival he discovers a new form of self-defence: Judo. The main character is based on Saigō Shirō.

The film is seen as an early example of Kurosawa's immediate grasp of the film-making process, and includes many of his directorial trademarks, such as the use of wipes, weather patterns as reflections of character moods, and abruptly changing camera speeds. The film itself was quite influential at the time, and has been remade on no fewer than five occasions. It spawned a sequel, <cite>Sanshiro Sugata Part II</cite>, which was released in 1945 and also directed by Kurosawa.

<h2>Themes</h2>
The central theme of the film is the education and initiation of Sugata and the way in which, whilst learning the ways of Judo, he also learns about himself. The film's central scene concerning this theme is when, after being accosted by Yano for getting involved in a streetfight, Sugata leaps into the cold waters near Yano's temple and stays there in order to show his master his dedication, and the fact that he is neither afraid to live nor to die.
